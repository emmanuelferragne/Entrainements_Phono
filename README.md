# Entrainements_Phono
This is a series of Praat scripts [Jennifer Krzonowski](http://www.ddl.cnrs.fr/Annuaires/index.asp?Langue=EN&Page=Jennifer+KRZONOWSKI&) and I wrote for intensive training sessions aimed at improving the perception and production of certain (British Standard) English phonological contrasts by French learners: 
- /iː/ vs /ɪ/
- /æ/ vs /ɑː/ vs /ʌ/

You need will [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/), correct soundcard settings with the right outputs and inputs enabled, and to download or clone this repo.

## Perception

The PERCEPTION folder contains 4 types of perceptual experiments (2-AFC, 5-AFC, AX, Oddity). Let's go through one of them to illustrate how they work. 
Open TRAINING_ODDITY.praat with Praat and Run it. 
In the first dialog box:
- choose any of the 2 sessions from the ''cond'' drop-down menu
- enter the ID of your choice in the text box

Then, you'll be prompted to select a file: select TRAINING_ODDITY.praat again. 
Instructions will appear on the screen. 

## Production

The PRODUCTION folder contains training exercises based on repetition. For optimal results, a good microphone and a very quiet environment are needed. Part of the method is based on automatic formant extraction, which is not 100% accurate. From our experience, it is good enough under optimal noise conditions and with typical voices. 

To get started, follow the same steps as with TRAINING_ODDITY.praat, this time with TRAINING_Prod1.praat. The only difference is you'll be prompted to provide your ''gender''; what this really means is: is your voice closer to a typical man's or woman's voice?

Then follow the instructions, and for every item you record, you'll get feedback as exemplified by the image:
