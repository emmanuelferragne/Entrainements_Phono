# Entrainements_Phono
This is a series a Praat scripts [Jennifer Krzonowski](http://www.ddl.cnrs.fr/Annuaires/index.asp?Langue=EN&Page=Jennifer+KRZONOWSKI&) and I wrote for intensive training sessions aimed at improving the perception and production of certain (British Standard) English phonological contrasts by French learners: 
- /iː/ vs /ɪ/
- /æ/ vs /ɑː/ vs /ʌ/

You need will [Praat](praat.org), correct soundcard settings with the right outputs and inputs enabled, and to download or clone this repo.

## Perception

The PERCEPTION folder contains 4 types of perceptual experiments (2-AFC, 5-AFC, AX, Oddity). Let's go through one of them to illustrate how they work. 
Open TRAINING_ODDITY.praat with Praat and Run it. 
In the first dialog box:
- choose any of the 2 sessions from the ''cond'' drop-down menu
- enter the ID of your choice in the text box

Then, you'll be prompted to select a file: select TRAINING_ODDITY.praat again. 
Instructions will appear on the screen.
