# Entrainements_Phono
This is a series a Praat scripts [Jennifer Krzonowski](http://www.ddl.cnrs.fr/Annuaires/index.asp?Langue=EN&Page=Jennifer+KRZONOWSKI&) and I wrote for intensive training sessions aimed at improving the perception and production of certain (British Standard) English phonological contrasts by French learners: 
- /iː/ vs /ɪ/
- /æ/ vs /ɑː/ vs /ʌ/
